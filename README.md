A game of deliveries, corporations, hyperinflation, and the metaverse

## Background
The year is 2250 and humanity has solved many problems, including energy, climate change, war and poverty. However, some challenges still exist. The main thing that challenges humanity is getting sensitive data delivered on time. All forms of cryptography have been cracked so transferring sensitive data via the internet is impossible, the only option is to use courier. Couriers are specially trained and drive highly tuned delivery vehicles. You are a beginner courier working your way up to more important tasks. Can you make your deliveries on time, or will you be stopped by your competitors?

## Theme
A solarpunk style theme. This is not to say that everything in the world is perfect, but the abundance of energy has helped humanity achieve a certain base level of equality which gives the world an easy going vibe. The couriers are an exception to this rule, they rush through a mostly calm environment to complete their delivieries and often clash with the people who are comfortable living their peaceful and easy lives.

## Characters

Socket: Your friendly neighbor who is also an expert mechanic
