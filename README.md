# burb-crash
A game of deliveries, racing, corporations, hyperinflation, and the metaverse

[Video Explanation](https://youtu.be/fB5AYH86mC0)

## Background
The year is 2250 and humanity has solved many problems, including energy, climate change, war and poverty. However, some challenges still exist. The main thing that challenges humanity is getting sensitive data delivered on time. All forms of cryptography have been cracked so transferring sensitive data via the internet is impossible, the only option is to use a courier. Couriers are specially trained and drive highly tuned delivery vehicles. You are a beginner courier working in the city of Despiro trying to work your way up to more important courier tasks. Can you make your deliveries on time, or will you be stopped by your competitors?

## Theme
A solarpunk style theme. This is not to say that everything in the world is perfect, but the abundance of energy has helped humanity achieve a certain base level of equality which gives the world an easy going vibe. The couriers are an exception to this rule, they rush through a mostly calm environment to complete their delivieries and often clash with the people who are comfortable living their peaceful and easy lives.

## Characters
You: The player of the game, are a novice courier, hoping to work your way up to more important deliveries and eager to gain access to the sensitive information that can come as you build your trust in the courier network.

Silo: Your best friend who is also a novice courier, he hopes to become an important courier, not for financial reasons, as he is quite comfortable (as is everyone in this world) but for the respect that being a high level courier brings.

Front: A courier two levels above you who has always had disrespect for newbies and wants to keep the courier business small and competitive.

Socket: Your friendly neighbor who is also an expert mechanic

## Companies

Exec7 - a multinational corporation that uses couriers mainly for delivering mundane business communications, but they have a special devision that works with more interesting data

Foam9 - The largest entertainment company in the world, they work with couriers to deliver confidential scripts and ideas for upcoming television shows and dramas. Their main goal is to prevent spoilers from reaching the internet.

BR772 - A robotics company specializing in robotic travel and human augmentation.

Window12 - The largest private communications network. Allows for citizens to send private messages to each other. Window12 utilizes a network of couriers to deliver messages between high ranking citizens. Only expert couriers will be selected for these as many of these messages are extremely private and important. Window12 has an extremely selective process when choosing which couriers to work with.

## Game Type
BurbCrash is a semi open world game, you can explore and test your car in a small area around your home, then jump into missions and complete challenges to explore more of the city. The main plot of the story is progressed by completing courier missions. Courier missions are more "on rails" game type that guide you from start to finish. They have specific time requirements or tasks that must be completed in order to finish the mission.

## Main Plot

### Phase 1: Training
You start with nothing but a dream to become a great courier. You must first pass the courier exam to ensure you can be trusted and know the rules of the courier guide book.

This is meant as a tutorial phase to teach the basic gameplay mechanics.

Everyone who passes the training phase can lease a basic courier vehicle to make some very basic deliveries.

The first deliveries are unimportant simple tasks meant to train new couriers and establish that they can be trusted

### Phase 2: The Come Up
After completing basic training and enough basic tasks you will gain a level of trust to start accepting missions from some of the main companies (listed above) at first you will only get the tasks that other higher ranking couriers do not want. These are easy missions such as delivering the script for C ranked t.v. shows for Foam9 or delivering messages about an executives upcoming suprise birthday party for Exec7.

Eventually though you will start getting missions that are more important and have more riding on them being delivered with speed and accuracy. This is where you will first start interacting with other couriers on an adversarial level. Couriers want to compete for these high status assignments, and will sabatoge or otherwise interfere with each other in order to ensure they receive the assignment.

You will have to work hard and upgrade your vechicle to be able to compete at this stage. Always watch out for Front who is focused on stopping you from progressing in the courier ranks.

### Phase 3: Somethings amiss...
You enter this phase after you have become recognized as one of the top couriers. You have proved that you are trustworthy and competent in your courier duties. You now start to receive missions that hint at a hidden underbelly to this solarpunk society. After completing certain missions from Window12 and BR772 you start to become aware of a plot that runs through the city.

### Phase 4: The reveal
You start putting the puzzle pieces together that your society is a house of cards waiting to crumble and Window12 and BR772 are at the center of it.

## Gameplay

### Courier Missions
Courier missions should focus around driving through busy city streets, alleyways, and dodging pedestrians, unexpected roadblocks and other couriers to complete your deliveries on time. Can have a Mirror's Edge vibe mixed with Subway surfer

### Example Mission Template
1. Assignment: You find a character in game who has a task they need a courier for. This starts out as doing small tasks for you neighbors and local businesses, but eventually you will be accepting high risk/reward tasks from CEO's of some of the largest companies and organizations in Despiro.
2. Mission start: After accepting a mission the open world will go away and in it's place the player will be put into the mission map. The mission map still resembles Despiro but will allow for more control over the environment.
3. Mission objective: The player will see the mission objective e.g. "Deliver Mr. Yamo's secret message to his business partners before 3:00 PM"
4. Mission complete: If the player succeeded in the mission they will be rewarded and experience will be gained.

The above flow should be followed for most missions, however the main storyline missions will be more complex.

### Courier Vehicle Upgrades
This is a main aspect of the game, you need to upgrade your vehicle in order to complete higher level missions and rise in the ranks of couriers. You will work with you neighbor Socket to upgrade your vehicle and can test it in the local streets before taking it on courier missions.

New parts will cost credits, so make sure you are saving them for the most effective upgrades.

Your robo-vehicle can be customized to perform better on differnt missions, some missons require pure speec, while other missions are better suited for an agile vehicle. You'll need to choose carefully before taking on a mission to ensure you vehicle can handle it. Some missions require an aspect of stealth and other missions need special upgrades such as grappling hooks, springs, or boosters.

You will do most vehicle upgrades in your neighbors garage but as you level up you can take your vehicle to more specialized shops for the best upgrades on the streets.

## Genre
Game should maintain a mostly solarpunk asthetic for the first 2 phases, in phase 3 you start to see cracks in the idealistic view of the world and a more cypberpunk aesthetic starts to come out, in phase 4 the game is mostly cyberpunk themed.

## Feasibility Analysis

### Personas
We target two user personas with our feasibiilty analysis report 1. Crypt Natives 2. Mobile Gamers

#### Crypto Native
##### Who are they?
Someone who is very familiar with interacting with web3 dapps via metamask. They are very involved in the crypto spaces watching videos, reading research, and interacting on crypto twitter

##### What is their main goal?
They want to explore new games that have a web3 or crypto element to them in order to better understand the ecosystem. These types of crypto natives tend to be early adopters and have an interest in gaming or have played games in the past. They want to have fun while using and learning about new technologies.

#### Mobile Gamer
##### Who are they?
Someone who avidly plays mobile games. They are familiar with basic gameplay mechanics and mobile gaming economies (pay for extra boosts/items). They play games for fun and to escape.

##### What is their main goal?
They want to enjoy playing a fun and engrossing game. They are not as concerned about the philosophy or technology behind the game as long as it stays out of their way and allows them to enjoy an fun and challenging game.

### Marketing

In order to target our crypto native users we can leverage channels that they are known to frequency. These channels include popular crypto YouTube channels, twitter accounts, and newsletters.

Giving them an incentive to download and play the game will be key to gaining adoption from these users. We can do this by giving them an airdrop, possibly of DeAuto credits or the in game token. This will incetivize early adoption. We can also host some aspect of the game on a layer 2 blockchain built for gaming, which will give them another incetive to try the game, as they are killing two birds with one stone i.e. they are gaining experience on the layer 2 blockchain and enjoying a game at the same time.

To target the mobile gamers we will need to reach out to popular gaming YouTube channels, and advertise in app stores and inside other popular mobile games. These users will need a great onboarding process as they may not be familiar with crypto and how to interact with web3 games.

### Game Play Research

The game play will be based off the game play of other very popular mobile games such as Subway Surfer. Along with this there will be a small open world element that will let the player explore the world, and upgrade and test their NAV before missions.

This type of game appeals to a broad audience as casual players can complete side missions or explore the world at their leisure, while hardcore gamers can focus on the main storyline and in game achievements.

Mobile games that have quick missions or levels can be very addictive and fun to play for millions of people. For example, Subway Surfers has 39.6M reviews and is rated 4.6 stars with over 1 billion downloads. Combine this fun gameplay mechanic of dodging enemies and traffic while attempting to deliver time sensitive information with crypto incentives and in game rewards and there is a hit in the making.
